          “EMDR Therapy changes maladaptive neural networks by connecting the
          traumatic memory with new information. The distressing thoughts and
          emotions are blended with new positive thoughts and emotions; embodied
          awareness allows frozen sensations in the body to resolve through
          healing movements.”
